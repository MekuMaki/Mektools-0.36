OMG A README?!

This addon is made for importing FBX Files to Blender. It works in Blender Version 4.1

However it is mostly centered around FFXIV Character Importing and animating in blender.

The addon is outdated and is having a huge overhaul currently over at https://github.com/MekuStudios/mektools
